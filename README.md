P.T.E : A simple PDF Text Extractor.

P.T.E. (PDF Text Extractor), is a simply python program, that would extract ASCII (English) text from a PDF, and save it to a text output file.


The 2 things the program will ask you for is the name of the PDF file, and the name you want the output text file to be.


NOTE:
Please make sure that the PDF and P.T.E. are in the same location. The output text file will be in the same location that P.T.E. is ran from.


I hope you find this helpful.
Thank you.
